# Kaggle_Digit_Recognizer

Brought to you by `Kaggle`, this repos is contains a `Jupyter Notebook` with a somewhat detailed guide to using Keras/Tensor to generate a CNN.

**Personal TODOs**
* **DigitRecognition_semi_tutorial**  How to make a dense neural net w/ Tensor & Keras, and a CNN with Keras
* **Keras CNN** The Keras Playground used for Kaggle submission
* **Tensor Flow CNN** Make a CNN with TensorFlow
* **Dense vs CNN** Compare the two
* **Tensor vs Keras** Compare the two
