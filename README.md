# Kaggle_Digit_Recognizer

Brought to you by `Kaggle`, this repos is contains a `Jupyter Notebook` with a somewhat detailed guide to using Keras to generate a CNN.

Personal ToDos:

* **Keras Dense**  Make a dense neural net w/ Keras
* **Tensor Dense** Make a dense neural net w/ TensorFlow
* **Put this up on GitHub** Pretty self explanatory
* **Keras CNN** Make a CNN with Keras
* **Tensor Flow CNN** Make a CNN with TensorFlow
* **Dense vs CNN** Compare the two
* **Tensor vs Keras** Compare the two
